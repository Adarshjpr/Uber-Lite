Key Components:

API Gateway: Single entry point with rate limiting and authentication

Microservices: Rider, Driver, Matching, Ride, Pricing, Payment, Notification, Geo, Analytics

Message Bus: Kafka for event-driven communication

Storage: MySQL/PostgreSQL with PostGIS for primary data, Redis for caching

Real-time Communication: WebSocket for live tracking and notifications

üîß Microservices & Responsibilities
Service	Responsibilities
Rider Service	User profile, saved locations, ride history
Driver Service	Driver onboarding, vehicle info, availability status
Matching Service	Nearest-driver selection, dispatch logic, match retries
Ride Service	Ride lifecycle management, saga pattern implementation
Pricing Service	Dynamic surge pricing, fare calculation
Payment Service	Idempotent payment processing, double-entry ledger
Notification Service	WebSocket push notifications, email/SMS fallbacks
Geo Service	Geohash-based location queries, ETA calculations, routing
Analytics Service	Data processing, KPI dashboards, business intelligence
üíæ Database & Caching Design
Primary Databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL):

rides table: ride_id, rider_id, driver_id, status, pickup_location, dropoff_location, fare, created_at

drivers table: driver_id, vehicle_info, current_status, rating, online_status

driver_locations table: driver_id, geohash, latitude, longitude, updated_at (PostGIS GiST index)

payments table: txn_id, ride_id, amount, status, idempotency_key

Caching (Redis):

Nearby drivers list (TTL: 30 seconds)

Surge pricing zones (TTL: 1 minute)

Active ride states (TTL: 1 hour)

Driver locations cache (TTL: 15 seconds)

üß† Key Concepts
Event-Driven Architecture: Kafka events for inter-service communication

CQRS Pattern: Separate read/write models for optimized queries

Microservices: Independent, scalable services with bounded contexts

Caching Strategy: Redis with TTL and cache stampede prevention

Security: JWT authentication, token rotation, role-based access

Resilience Patterns: Circuit breakers, retries, idempotency keys

üåê API Boundaries (High-Level)
Rider Service:

POST /api/riders - Create rider profile

GET /api/riders/{id}/rides - Get ride history

Driver Service:

POST /api/drivers/availability - Update driver availability

GET /api/drivers/{id}/earnings - Get driver earnings

Matching Service:

POST /api/matching/request - Request ride matching

GET /api/matching/nearby-drivers - Find nearby drivers

Ride Service:

POST /api/rides - Create ride request

PATCH /api/rides/{id}/status - Update ride status

Geo Service:

GET /api/geo/nearby-drivers - Get drivers near location

GET /api/geo/eta - Calculate estimated arrival time

Payment Service:

POST /api/payments/charge - Process payment

POST /api/payments/refund - Initiate refund
